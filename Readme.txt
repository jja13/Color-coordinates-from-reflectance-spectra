Created by Joel Alpízar Castillo and Rogelio José Fernández Barquero for the Spectroscopy
Laboratory of the Physics Department of the Costa Rica Institute of Technology.

When you work with your own spectra, work over the attatched document ("reflectancias.csv"), but
be careful to follow the structure required, using "." instead of "," for the decimals. Each
value is separated with ";" and starting in the second row since the first is the columns
description. Note that the reflectance measures must be done each 5 nm due to the standard
tabuleted values given by the CIE.

In the reflectancias.csv archive you will find several columns. The first is the wavelength and
you must be sure you are working on 5 nm inverval values and their respective reflectance,
starting in 380 nm and ending on 750 nm. The following columns are differen pantone colors, you
must change those values for your own spectra, but make sure your values are based on a decimal
reflectance and not on percentage, and take the considerations aforementioned.

Please, do not modify the "xyzbarras.csv" archive. It storage the tabulated values needed for
the code.
